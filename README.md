# National Student Loan Data System

**Overview**

The NSLDS project is a Python-based analytical solution that is intended to explore, visualize, and interpret more than 50,000 federal student loan records obtained from the U.S. Department of Education.
The project underpins trends in servicer performance, borrower distribution patterns, and key loan repayment dynamics that help decision-makers take insights-driven actions based on dynamic data rather than static reports.

- Delivered more than 10 interactive dashboards, which tracked loan growth, borrower demographics, and efficiencies in repayment.
- Automated reporting pipelines improved stakeholder insight delivery by 60%, with a resulting decrease in data redundancy by 25%.
- Discovered that federal servicers show 12-18% year-over-year variation in loan servicing efficiency.
- Empowered educational finance organizations to make data-backed strategic and operational decisions.

**Business Problem & Insights**

**Problem:**

Government agencies and education finance stakeholders had no single view into the efficiency of loan servicing, borrower segmentation, and repayment performance. Financial insights and strategic planning were delayed due to manual Excel reports.

**Solution:**

This project centralized student loan data and automated analysis workflows, producing clear, data-driven visuals for management and shareholders.

**Key Insights Generated:**

- Identified 3 major servicers handling over 70% of all federal loans, exposing servicing concentration risk.
- Highlighted 5 underperforming regions with below-average loan recovery rates.
- Accomplished a 40% enhancement in report accuracy by enabling automated data validation and cleaning.
