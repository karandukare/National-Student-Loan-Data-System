# National-Student-Loan-Data-System
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). The dataset provides insights into different types of student loans, such as Direct Loans, FFEL Loans, Perkins Loans, and Consolidation Loans. The goal of this analysis is to understand loan distribution, trends over fiscal years, and borrower behaviors across categories.

The project uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Key steps include importing and structuring raw CSV data, handling missing values, renaming and mapping columns for clarity, and creating insightful visual representations such as loan type comparisons, fiscal year trends, and borrower statistics.

Key Features:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning for consistency

* Fiscal Year and Quarter-based loan aggregation

* Trend visualization using Matplotlib

* Analysis of loan categories and repayment patterns

* Export of processed results for portfolio insights

Tools & Technologies:

* Python

* Pandas

* Matplotlib

* Jupyter Notebook / HTML Export

Objective:

To provide a clear, data-driven overview of U.S. federal student loan portfolio dynamics and borrower trends to support better understanding of debt distribution and policy implications.
